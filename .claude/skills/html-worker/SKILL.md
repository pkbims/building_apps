description: Work with the user through an interactive HTML page served locally, where they click through content, answer decisions, and leave comments anchored to specific blocks that arrive in batches. Use when the user wants to review, shape, or decide on something visually rather than in terminal prose - specs, plans, designs, options, anything long enough that pointing at a part of it beats describing it. Not tied to any document type.

# HTML worker

A review loop where the user reacts to a page instead of to paragraphs. They click,
comment on specific blocks, queue those comments, and send them in batches. You read the
batch and revise the page.

This skill owns the mechanics only. What goes *in* the page is not its concern.

## When this beats plain conversation

Use it when the user must react to many things and pointing is easier than describing —
long documents, sets of options, layouts, flows. Do not use it for a single question or a
short answer; a page is heavier than a sentence and should earn its weight.

## Setup

**Inside an app, don't start a server.** A page in an app folder (`app_N/…` or a
`research/<niche>/` started from the App Maker) is served by that app's one server — see the
`app-maker` skill; it appears in the App Maker's navbar on the next load. **The folder needs an `index.html` AND a `state.json`
(`echo '{}' > <dir>/state.json`)** — without it the app server doesn't count the folder as a page, every `/api/*` call
404s, and the Chat center looks broken (empty contents list, no "→ agent" under Send). Register it in
`<app>/.appmaker.json → agents`, gitignore its `state.json` + `INBOX.md`, replace both `TITLE HERE`s, and open it in a
browser before giving the link (app_1, 2026-09-28). The steps below are
for a page that lives outside any app (a review of the pipeline itself, say).

Work in a `<project>/<name>/` directory. Copy `server.py` from this skill beside the page.

```bash
mkdir -p <dir> && cp <skill>/server.py <dir>/
echo "$HERDR_PANE_ID" > <dir>/.agent   # who Send wakes (see Waking up); gitignore it
cd <dir> && python3 server.py    # first free port from 7777 up
```

**Never assume the port.** Other pages are often already running, so the server takes
the first free port from 7777 upward and writes it to `<dir>/.port`. Read that file after
starting, and use that port for the URL, the `curl` checks and the stop command.
`PORT=N` pins a port and fails if it is taken.

It binds to localhost. `HOST=0.0.0.0 python3 server.py` opens it to the local network so
the user can open the page — or a `prototype.html` beside it — on their phone at
`http://<mac-ip>:<port>/` (`ipconfig getifaddr en0` gives the address).

**Run the server in the herdr `servers-tab`, not as a background task and not as a split of
the user's pane**, if the user is inside herdr (`$HERDR_ENV` is 1). Harness background tasks
get killed under memory pressure, and the user wants their session pane kept at full size:

```bash
.claude/scripts/server-pane.sh <dir> "python3 server.py"   # prints the pane id
```

To stop it, `lsof -ti tcp:$(cat <dir>/.port) | xargs kill`. **`pkill` does not reliably kill it.**

Give the user the URL only after checking it serves *this* page — match the `<title>`, e.g.
`curl -s localhost:$(cat <dir>/.port)/ | grep -o '<title>[^<]*'`. A bare 200 can come from
another page's server on the port you guessed, and the server crashing on bind looks the same.

## The page contract

Build the page from `page-template.html`. The JavaScript is already wired; only add
content. Three attributes do everything:

- `data-anchor="id" data-label="Short name"` on any block makes it commentable. Add
  `<button class="cbtn">comment</button>` as its first child.
- `data-radio="id"` around radio inputs records a single-choice decision.
- `data-check="id"` around checkboxes records a multi-choice decision.
  **Every input needs `name="id"` matching its group** — radios and checkboxes alike. A
  checkbox without it saves under an empty key and its group reads as unanswered.

**Every decision carries Claude's recommendation.** Exactly one option is marked
*recommended* (a small tag on the option) with a one-line reason in its description — for
checkbox groups, say which boxes you'd tick and why in the decision's "why" line. Never
pre-select it: the user still clicks. A decision with no recommendation is a bug — it hands
the user bare labels. The only exception is a question about the user's own taste or facts
Claude cannot know (e.g. "which room is yours"); then say so in the "why" line.

Decisions save the instant they are clicked, and clicking a chosen option again clears it. Send names what it
will send ("Send 1 decision, 2 comments, 4 changes") and dims to "Nothing to send" otherwise.
**When you write a decision yourself** (carrying answers over, retiring an id), POST it with
`"baseline": true`, or Send counts your write as the user's unsent change. **Discard** (header) closes
the review for good: the server moves the page folder to `~/.Trash/<name>-<time>`, wakes you
to say so, and stops. Don't restart it or recreate the page unless asked. Comments do not send until the user confirms.
That split is deliberate: decisions are state and must survive a refresh, comments are
messages the user should be able to draft, edit and delete first.

## The round loop, and the Chat center

The right-hand column is the **Chat center** (rebuilt 2026-09-27): decisions in brief ("✓ 51 of 51
decided", what changed since the last round, the full list behind "show all"), **Send** with the name
of who receives it (`→ code-orchestrator · working`), then a thread of everything the user said —
*Waiting* expanded (long conversations show only the latest message, "▸ N earlier messages"),
*Answered* folded to one line. It is pinned at full window height with its own scroll, so the page and
the chat scroll separately; Send stays pinned at its top. Narrow windows: a **💬 Chat center** button
slides it in. **💬 General comment** (under Send) is for anything not about one block; it shows as "general" in the thread.

Three kinds of comment, picked on the popup, handled differently:

- **Change request** — waits in the thread until **Send**; revise the page. The page is the spec;
  the revision is the answer.
- **Question** — goes **straight away**. Answer it **on the page, in its thread** — never only in the
  terminal: `python3 .claude/skills/html-worker/reply.py <page_dir> <id> "answer"`. Short, plain;
  `**bold**`, `` `code` ``, line breaks and `- ` bullets render. **Links must be clickable** (user, 2026-09-28): write
  every link as a full `http://…`/`https://…` URL, outside backticks — the page turns those into links; `localhost:8080`
  without `http://`, or a URL inside backticks, stays plain text. Don't revise the page for a question:
  if the answer implies a change, add `--suggest` — the page shows **Make it a change request** and
  the user decides.
- **Note** ("Comment") — queues with change requests and comes with Send (user, 2026-09-28: "I dont like the
  comment as send now"); acknowledge it in one line with `reply.py` (what you took from it).

The user can **reply** under any answer; the follow-up comes with the whole conversation, so answer
the follow-up, not the first question again.

**How you hear about it.** Inside an app, the App Maker's app server types a prompt into your pane:
immediately for **Send** (a round — read `INBOX.md`), and for questions/notes/replies a few seconds
after the last one, bundled, with each id and its conversation. Without the App Maker, the page's own
server does the same through `<dir>/.agent` (see Waking up), and also writes `INBOX.md` on every
message and send.

The round itself:

1. The user presses **Send**. The server snapshots decisions into a round, marks queued changes
   sent, and writes `INBOX.md` — what changed, what is still unanswered, every decision, and every
   open comment with its id and conversation.
2. Revise the page for change requests; answer anything still open with `reply.py`. No server
   restart is needed for HTML changes.
3. Mark comments addressed so the next round does not repeat them:
   `curl -s -X POST localhost:$(cat <dir>/.port)/api/comment/addressed -d '{}'` (inside an app:
   `localhost:$(cat <app>/.appserver.port)/<page path>/api/comment/addressed`) — always **through the
   server**, never by editing `state.json`.
4. Say in the thread (or the terminal, if no one is watching the page) what changed and what is open.

Inside the App Maker the page hides its own header (it runs in a frame); the App Maker shows the
round and the counts in its header, from the page's `report()` message.

## The "Claude is working" bar

After the user sends a round, the page shows a strip under the header: **"Claude is working on
round N…"** with a spinner. It turns into **"Round N revision is ready — Reload"** when either
the page file changes (you rebuilt it) or every comment from that round is marked addressed.
After four minutes with neither, it says to type "sent" in the terminal. It survives a
reload, and a page that sends by its own button (e.g. a stage gate) calls
`window.markWorking(round)` so the bar shows there too.

**Your side of it:** end every round by rebuilding the page *or* marking the comments
addressed — ideally both. A round with only decisions and no revision needed still needs one
of them (`touch index.html` is enough), or the user watches a spinner that never stops.

## Waking up

**A round must never be missed** (user, 2026-09-30, after one sat unread). The page's server wakes
you directly, the way the App Maker does: on **Send** it runs `herdr agent prompt <pane>` with a
prompt to read `INBOX.md`, and questions/replies follow a few seconds after the last one, bundled.
The pane comes from `<dir>/.agent`, written at setup from `$HERDR_PANE_ID`. **Without that file the
server can't wake anyone**, so write it every time. The Chat center then shows who Send goes to
(`→ claude · working`).

Outside herdr (no `$HERDR_PANE_ID`) there is no `.agent`, and a background watcher is the only way
back. Start it in the same turn the server comes up. It blocks on the file and exits when it
changes, which re-invokes you:

```bash
INBOX=<dir>/INBOX.md
start=$(stat -f %m "$INBOX" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
while :; do
  cur=$(stat -f %m "$INBOX" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  [ "$cur" != "$start" ] && { echo "new round sent"; break; }
  sleep 15
done
```

**Tell the user the watcher is unreliable.** It only works as a harness background task, and those
get reaped. Say plainly: if they confirm and hear nothing within a minute, they should say
"sent". Restart it after each round. It fires once and exits.

## Rules learned the hard way

- **Only the server writes `state.json`.** Editing it from a script while the server runs
  loses answers to a read-modify-write race. Use `POST /api/decision` instead.
- **Never orphan an answer.** If you replace a decision's options, migrate the existing
  value or it silently reads as unanswered. Retire a dropped id with
  `POST /api/decision {"id": ..., "value": null}`.
- **State lives on disk, not in server memory.** Servers die. Nothing else should.
- **One page, not tabs.** Tabs fragment an argument and let people start in the middle.
  Use a sticky contents rail for navigation and `<details>` for reference material.
- **Comment anchors should be fine-grained.** A comment on a whole section is hard to act
  on; one on a specific decision is unambiguous.
- Verify structure after generating a large page: balanced `<div>` counts, matching
  section tags, and that every `data-radio` sits inside a block with a `data-anchor`.

## Updating existing pages after a skill change

Pages are copies of the template beside copies of `server.py`, so a change to the skill
does not reach page directories that already exist. `sync.py <page-dir> ...` brings a
directory up to date: the page's `<style>`, font `<link>`, theme script, comment popup
and page `<script>` are swapped for the template's, and `server.py` / `export-md.py`
are replaced. `<main>` content, anchors and `state.json` are untouched. Refresh the
browser; restart the server (it loads `server.py` once) — in its herdr pane if that is
where it runs. `theme-lab/index.html` is a preview page for trying palettes, fonts and
sizes against real template markup before changing the template.

## Marking what changed

Reviewers lose track of what moved between rounds. When you revise a block, add
`data-changed="N"` to it, N being the round the revision answers. The left rail then opens
with "Changed in round N" — every block from the latest round, clickable, flashed on
arrival — and each such block carries an orange edge and tag. Blocks marked with earlier
rounds keep their tag but drop out of the rail. Put the attribute on the smallest block
that changed, not the whole section, and give it a `data-label` that says what changed
("R8 rewritten", "task catalogue — new").

## Exporting to Markdown

`export-md.py` converts the page into Markdown so there is one source, not two. Copy it
beside the page and run it; set `OUT` (path relative to the page dir's parent) and `TITLE`.
Links survive as Markdown links, so quoted evidence stays traceable; comment buttons and
section numbers are dropped.

It handles sections and headings, paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, `table.t`, `pre.code`,
`<details>`, `.plain` as a quote and `.risk` as a `> [!WARNING]` callout. Mermaid blocks
become ```` ```mermaid ```` fences, which GitHub renders — keep `<br/>` inside node labels
intact rather than converting it to a newline, or the diagram breaks.

Decision blocks render with the recorded answer marked **→** and the rejected options
listed beneath, so the exported document shows what was chosen *and* what was turned down.

**Never hand-write a second narrative alongside the page.** Doing that produces two
documents that drift, and the markdown ends up a thin summary of the real thing. If part
of the page is generated by JavaScript — mockups built from an array, for example — the
exporter must pull that content out of the script too, or those sections come out empty.
